Question-- Given N integers, count the number of pairs of integers whose difference is K . The first line contains N and K. The second line contains N numbers of the set. All the N numbers are unique. Sample Input 5 2 1 5 3 4 2 Sample Output 3

Answer-- A simple solution is to consider all pairs one by one and check difference between every pair. Following program implements the simple solution. We run two loops: the outer loop picks the first element of pair, the inner loop looks for the other element. This solution doesnâ€™t work if there are duplicates in array as the requirement is to count only distinct pairs.
