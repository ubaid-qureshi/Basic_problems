"""
Question--Given N integers, count the number of pairs of integers whose
difference is K . The first line contains N and K.
The second line contains N numbers of the set. All the N numbers are unique.
Sample Input 5 2 1 5 3 4 2 Sample Output 3

Answer -- A simple solution is to consider all pairs one by one and check difference
between every pair. Following program implements the simple solution.
We run two loops: the outer loop picks the first element of pair,
the inner loop looks for the other element.
This solution doesnâ€™t work if there are duplicates in array as the requirement
is to count only distinct pairs.

# Solution in Python
n = [5, 2, 1, 5, 3, 4, 2]
k = 3


def countPairsWithDiffK (n, k):
    count = 0
    for i in n:
        for j in range(k):
            if (i - n[j]) == k:  # if (i - n[j]) == k or (n[j] - i) == k: , use as required
                count += 1

    return count


print(countPairsWithDiffK(n, k))
